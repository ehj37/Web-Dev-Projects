          You open your eyes. You have no clue where you are, and you feel a dull, throbbing pain in your head. As you
          come to your senses, you sit up. You're greeted by the sight of a camp fire, and basked in its warm glow you
          can make out a number of silhouetted figures along its perimeter. You recognize none of them. You call out,
          but nobody seems to hear. Frustrated, you attempt to get up, only to find that you can't. Suddenly, amidst the
          fire's crackles and hisses, you hear a voice. "One," it says loudly. Another chimes in. "Two". "Three," you
          say before you can stop yourself. "Four" says another. "Five". Suddenly, the word "six" rings out from two
          members of the circle. You scowl at them. Once again, silence befalls the group. You can feel the rage
          building up inside of you. To think, you could have made it to seven if not for that careless blunder. Cutting
          through the silence like a blade, a voice sings through the night: "one". "Two," you say. "Three". "Four". And
          so on...

          "The number game," as I call it, it a dumb game to be played when there's no conversation to be had. The
          group's goal is to count up from zero. Anybody can start by saying "one", and then a different member of the
          group chimes in with "two". No member of the group can say two numbers in a row (i.e. someone can't rattle off
          "onetwothreefourfivesix" to advance the counter), and no coordination can be made relating to who says what
          when. This counting up continues until someone says a number that breaks the sequence, at which point the
          counter resets to zero. This game is best played with a large group, as it becomes more and more difficult to
          gauge when there's an opening to advance the counter without coming into conflict with someone else's attempt.
