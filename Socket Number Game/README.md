# Socket Number Game
A basic adaptation of "the number game," a game where one person says "one," another says "two," and so on. A player cannot
say two numbers in a row, and if someone breaks the sequence then the counter is reset to zero. Examples of breaking the 
sequence are two people typing "5" at the same time, someone typing in "5000" when the counter is at "12," and someone 
typing "6" when the counter is at "7".

To run the game, install dependencies and initiate the server.js file. The server for this game is hosted locally, so open 
127.0.0.1:4000 in a few different tabs and have a joyous time playing this game all by yourself like a sociopath.

Designed to be mobile friendly.
