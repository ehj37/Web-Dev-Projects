COMC is an online marketplace for buying and selling trading cards.

As a seller on COMC, checking to see which of your cards have been outpriced is a tedious task.

This Chrome extension improves this experience by adding a button to the inventory manager that, when clicked, only displays your cards that have been outpriced.

To use this extension, first download the ‘Web-Dev-Projects’ zip, unzip it, and place the 'COMC Chrome Extension' folder somewhere you'll remember.

Next, head to chrome://extensions/.

Enable developer mode in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

Next, in the upper left-hand corner, click ‘Load unpacked’ and navigate to the ‘COMC Chrome Extension’ folder.

Select this folder.

Voila! Go to the COMC inventory manager to find a helpful new button!

To remove this extension go to chrome://extensions/ and either remove it or press the button in the lower right-hand corner.
